# Rock, Paper, Scissors

The simple hand game Rock, Paper, Scissors has many names and variations. It's a game that's played all over the world and is frequently used to make judgments. It is even played for sport in some circumstances. Competing players must use one hand to form one of three shapes at a predetermined time, according to the rules. The game is won by the player who plays the most powerful "item."

# Items

**Rock** (a closed fist), **paper** (a flat hand), and **scissors** which is identical to the two-finger V sign that symbolizes victory or peace except that it is pointed horizontally rather than held upright in the air.

# Rules

A draw, a win, or a loss are the three possible outcomes. A player who chooses to play rock will defeat a player who chooses to play scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or occasionally "blunts scissors"), but will lose to a player who chooses to play paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). The game is tied if both players choose the same shape, and it is frequently repeated to break the tie.

_So in order of priority we have Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock_
